							<h2>In the past what challenges did immigrants face when coming to Canada, what challenges are there now?</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>Immigration is very important and interesting to me because both of my parents are immigrants. I want to learn how immigration to Canada changed over the years and what challenges my parents had to overcome when immigrating.
								<br><br>
								My question is: 
								<strong>In the past what challenges did immigrants face when coming to Canada, what challenges are there now?</strong>

							<p>This article talks about Wong Foon Sien who was a leading figure in the fight for human and civil rights for Chinese Canadians. In the 20th century Chinese Candians were considered residents of the British Empire but not Canadian citizens therefore they weren't granted full rights and privileges. Wong Foon Sien tirelessly worked for Chinese Canadian rights and laid a strong foundation for the future advancement of immigrants' rights in Canada.</p>

											<ul>
											<li><strong>Currency:</strong></li> 
											This article was published in 2020 and includes studies and references between 2003 and 2018. The information has not been updated or revised recently but my topic doesn't require extremely new information so older sources will work. This article passes the currency test.
											<li><strong>Relevance:</strong></li>
											This article is relevant, it includes information related to my topic as it tells you about issues immigrants face nowadays, it includes 11 different references and is at an appropriate level. I would be comfortable citing this source in my research paper.
											<li><strong>Authority:</strong></li>
											The author of this paper is Davies, Jennifor Lee who is currently the manager in Career Development services at the University of Toronto. The paper was advised by Charles Chen who is a professor at OISE and a Canada Research Chair in Life Career Development. In my opinion these two people are qualified to write on the topic as they have been working in this field for more than 15 years.
											<li><strong>Accuracy:</strong></li>
											The information comes from many different sources, they include studies done from other professors, studies from major news corporations, like <strong>Forbes</strong> and <strong>Toronto Star</strong>. There are no grammar errors, I can verify the information as they left all the references at the bottom of the page and the language/tone they used felt very unbiased. 
											<br>
											Also, I can also somewhat relate to the information told by this article. Our friend (Han Jie) has a bachelors degree in biochemistry that she got in China and was able to find a job right after University. When she moved to Canada she wasn't able to find any employment and was forced to move back to China. Her struggle to find employment in her field was very difficult even though she was qualified for those jobs. Of course there are definetly other factors at play that didn't allow her to find employment but this article shined a light into the problems she was facing.
											<li><strong>Purpose:</strong></li>
											The purpose of this information is to inform everyone that there may be discrimination towards immigrant workers. They show many statistics and talk about the unconcious discrimination against immigrants. This information is factual and for me, it passed the CRAAP test.

										<p>This article lists the top 12 challenges immigrants face when coming to Canada.</p>
										<div class="gallery">
											<ul>
											<li><strong>Currency:</strong> This information was posted in 2021 and is very up to date. My topic requires current sources about immigration and the challenges that occur. This link passed the Currency test.</li> 
											<li><strong>Relevance:</strong> The information presented in this article is related to my topic, the intended audience is everyone who wants to know what challenges immigrating to Canada has. I would say the information is at an appropriate level however I wouldn't be comfortable citing this source in a research paper as it wasn't done by a proper author and there are no references for me to check. This didn't pass the relevance test.</li>
